    "*All the methods for approximating the solution to initial-value problems have error terms that involve a higher derivative of the solution of the equation. If the derivative can be reasonably bounded, then the method will have a predictable error bound that can be used to estimate the accuracy of the approximation. Even if the derivative grows as the steps increase, the error can be kept in relative control, provided that the solution also grows in magnitude. Problems frequently arise, however, when the magnitude of the derivative increases but the solution does not. In this situation, the error can grow so large that it dominates the calculations. Initial-value problems for which this is likely to occur are called stiff equations and are quite common, particularly in the study of vibrations, chemical reactions, and electrical circuits.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Stiff differential equations are characterized as those whose exact solution has a term of the form $e^{−ct}$ , where $c$ is a large positive constant. This is usually only a part of the solution, called the transient solution. The more important portion of the solution is called the steady-state solution. The transient portion of a stiff equation will rapidly decay to zero\n",
    "as $t$ increases, but since the n-th derivative of this term has magnitude $c^n e^{−ct}$, the derivative does not decay as quickly. In fact, since the derivative in the error term is evaluated not at t, but at a number between zero and $t$, the derivative terms can increase as $t$ increases (and very rapidly indeed). Fortunately, stiff equations generally can be predicted from the physical problem from which the equation is derived and, with care, the error can be kept under control. The manner in which this is done is considered in this section.*\n"
