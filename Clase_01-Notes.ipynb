    "Whenever the numerical problem (NP) is an approximation of a mathematical problem (MP) and this latter is in turn a model of a physical problem (PP), we say that NP ($F_n(x_n,d_n)=0$) is a computational model for PP.\n",

    "The global error $e=|x_{ph}-x_n|$ can be interpreted as the sum of the MP error $e_m = x-x_{ph}$ and the computational problem error $e_c=\\hat{x}-x$ ($e=e_m+e_c$).\n",

    "In general, we can enumerate the following sources of error:   \n",
    "1. Errors due to the model, that can be **reduced** by using a proper model.\n",
    "2. Errors due to data, that can be **reduced** improving the measurement's accuracy.\n",
    "3. Truncation errors, arising from the approximation (truncation) of limit operations (integrals, derivatives,...).\n",

    "Type 3 and 4 errors give rise to the computational error. A numerical method will be convergent if this error can be made arbitrarily small increasing the computational effort. Although convergence is the primary goal of a numerical method, there are also the accuracy, the reliability and the efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy means that the errors are small with respect to a fixed tolerance. It is usually quantified by the infinitesimal order of the error $e_n$ with respect to the discretization characteristic parameter (for example the largest grid spacing).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Machine precision does not limit, theoretically, the accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliability means that it is very likely that the global error is below a certain tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency means that the computational (effort) complexity needed to control the error (number of operations and memory) is as small as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Algorithm is a directive that indicates, through elementary operations, all the passages needed to solve a problem. It should finish after a finite number of steps, and as a consequence the executor (man or machine) must find within the algorithm itself all the instructions to completely solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity of an algorithm is a measure of its executing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity of a problem is the complexity of the algorithm with smallest complexity capable of solving the problem."
